# Cat-Dog-Classification

Image Classification is one of the most interesting and useful applications of Deep neural networks and Convolutional Neural Networks that enables us to automate the task of assembling similar images and arranging data without the supervision of real humans.

Cat & Dog Classification using Convolutional Neural Network in Python
we will learn how to build a classifier using a simple Convolution Neural Network which can classify the images of dogs and cats.
